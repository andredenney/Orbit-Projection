#Orbit-Projection
Project aimed at solving differential equations of orbital motion

Asteroid Orbit Projection project

Finished December 2017

University of Minnesota - PHYS 4041

Motivated by the discovery of the Oumuamua asteroid in October 2017, I was able to build a program centered around solving ordinary differential equations of motion in order to predict the future trajectory of the asteroid as it traverses and eventually leaves our solar system.
